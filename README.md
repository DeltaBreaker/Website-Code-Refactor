# Website-Code-Refactor
This repo was created to refactor the HTML and CSS code written for this website to be more accessable and sustainable. Many aspects needed to be changed to allow for future maintenance.

---

## Steps Taken
- The first improvement made was renaming the numerous 'div' elements to have more descriptive names.
- After renaming elements the CSS code had to be altered to maintain the initial design.
- Next, many of the blocks of CSS code were condensed into a single class to prevent excess code from cluttering the file.
- Alt attributes also needed to be added to image elements for accessability.
- Lastly, comments needed to be added explaining the code to assist future developers if it ever needed to be updated or changed.
